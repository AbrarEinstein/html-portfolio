      I am Md. Ahasan Habib. I am a metallurgist. I am working as an Engineer in
      quantum electric arc furnace. I love to learn new things. But when things
      get hard, I tend to become hopeless and stop learning. This is my biggest
      weakness. In past 15 years, I have tried to learn a lot of things and then
      stop learning. But now again I am trying to learn. And this my goal is to
      just continue learning, nothing else.
